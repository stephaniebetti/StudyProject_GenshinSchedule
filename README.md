# Project Description
The Weekly Schedule for Genshin Impact was developed to help me manage my daily activities in the game more efficiently. Each character has a specific day when their items become available for farming (for example, Wednesday is the day to farm talent ascension materials for character X). To simplify this routine, I created a website that allows me to check this information without needing to log into the game.

As a dedicated Genshin Impact player, I realized that the process of checking which characters and items required my daily attention was tedious. I often had to log in, navigate through multiple menus, and click around to find out which items I should focus on. This project provided a solution that not only helped me organize my time better but also served as a valuable learning opportunity in programming.

# How to Use
1. Select the day of the week for which you want to receive information (e.g., Monday).
2. Click on "View Activities."
3. Check the screen for the characters and items that need your attention that day.

# Final Considerations
The goal of the website is to be completely straightforward and intuitive, allowing users to quickly and easily find the information they need.
